This project builds a movie recommendation system using the cosine similarity algorithm to suggest movies based on their content. It utilizes Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer to extract features such as genres, keywords, cast, and directors from the movie dataset. The combined features of each movie are then transformed into vectors, and cosine similarity is computed between them. Upon entering a movie name, the system provides recommendations by sorting other movies based on their cosine similarity score with the selected movie
